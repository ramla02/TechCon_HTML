                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>TechCon began in 1998 as a small gathering of developers in San Francisco and has since evolved into a globally recognized technology conference, drawing thousands of innovators, entrepreneurs, and tech leaders each year. Initially focused on open-source software and web development, the event expanded rapidly through the 2000s, embracing topics like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. By 2012, it had gone international, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, it transitioned to a fully virtual format, reaching a record-breaking global audience. Today, TechCon continues to lead conversations around emerging tech, ethical innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity—firmly establishing itself as both a reflection of technological progress and a driving force behind its future.</p>
